What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Initializing a repository creates a .git directory inside the current
directory. It's a crucial first step to tracking a project with git because
the .git directory stores all the meta-data used to track commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area is a place to decide what goes into a commit. If there
were no staging area and you'd changed several files, you would have no
way of breaking those changes into several commits, even if they constituted
different logical changes. The staging area allows you to break up current
changes into several commits if you so desire.
