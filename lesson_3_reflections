When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- If for no other reason, it is a good backup to whatever is on your local machine.
Also, if your local master is not 'production ready' and you're trying to share
your software with others via github, it would make sense to have the remote be the
most recent stable version.
