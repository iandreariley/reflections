When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

- If for no other reason, it is a good backup to whatever is on your local
machine. Also, if your local master is not 'production ready' and you're trying
to share your software with others via github, it would make sense to have the
remote be the most recent stable version.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- If commits are pushed to the remote by another person working on the same
project, your project may be updated in ways that would break it.
